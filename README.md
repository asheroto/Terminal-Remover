# Windows Terminal Remover

This was mainly created because I found that uninstalling Windows Terminal did not actually remove it entirely.

# What it Does

- Removes Appx package
- Removes `$ENV:ProgramFiles\WindowsApps\*WindowsTerminal*` folders (which requires taking ownership, granting permissions, removing in use files and some registry keys)

# Instructions

Just open it up and read! 😀
